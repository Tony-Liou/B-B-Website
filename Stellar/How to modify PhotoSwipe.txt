Photo Swipe 可刪減部分

First things that you should know before you start:

All code in the documentation is pure Vanilla JS and supports IE 8 and above.
If your website or app uses some JavaScript framework (like jQuery or MooTools) or you don't need to support old browsers – feel free to simplify the code.

Avoid serving big images (larger than 2000x1500px) for mobile, as they will dramatically reduce animation performance and can cause crash (especially on iOS Safari).
Possible solutions: serve responsive images, or open image on a separate page, or use libraries that support image tiling.
